## Overview

This is a simple chess game implemented in Java using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and the Observer pattern. The graphical user interface is built with the Java Swing library, providing a visually interactive chess-playing experience.

## Features

- **MVC Architecture**: The codebase follows the MVC design pattern, which separates the application logic into three components: Model, View, and Controller. This promotes code organization, maintainability, and ease of extension.

- **Observer Pattern**: The Observer pattern is employed to enable communication between components of the MVC architecture. This allows for updates and changes in one part of the application to be reflected in other parts seamlessly.

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: The game features a user-friendly graphical interface built with Java Swing. Players can make moves using a click-and-drag mechanism, and the GUI dynamically updates to reflect the current state of the chessboard.
